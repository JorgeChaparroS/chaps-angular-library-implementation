# Implementation of chaps-angular-library
Library for Angular reusable components 

This application is just a landing page to show the components defined in the chaps-angular-lib (available in NPM if you want to use it https://www.npmjs.com/package/chaps-angular-lib?activeTab=readme#chapsangularlib). 

# Installation Steps for local environment: 
1. In your workspace, clone the repository with "git clone https://github.com/JorgeChaparroS/chaps-angular-library"
2. Type "cd chaps-angular-library"
3. Install dependencies with "npm i"
4. Run the application with "npm run start" or "ng serve"

# Using it in your project: 
1. Just make sure you have a Node project, and then install the dependency on it by typing: npm i chaps-angular-lib
2. Remember that this library depends on bootstrap, so you better install it as well by typing: npm i bootstrap. (and configure your angular.json too.)
